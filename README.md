## Problem

Households, small teams, and extended families routinely live across **multiple calendar providers** — a Google personal account, a Google Workspace work account, a Microsoft 365 account. Seeing everyone's real availability in one place normally means either switching apps constantly or handing sensitive credentials to a third-party SaaS.

## Solution

`mb-ss-dashboard` is a self-hostable app that pulls events from connected Google and Microsoft accounts via each provider's API, normalizes and categorizes them, and renders a unified multi-user calendar — while keeping credentials and tokens inside **your own** Supabase instance with Row-Level Security enforcing per-user isolation.

## Features

- **Multi-account aggregation** — connect any number of Google and Microsoft accounts per user.
- **Color-coded users** — distinct color per connected account so conflicts are obvious.
- **Smart categorization** — events auto-tagged as `work`, `gym`, `appointment`, etc. via user-defined auto-rules.
- **Month / week / day views** powered by FullCalendar.
- **Filter by person or category** — instant client-side filtering.
- **Background sync** — 15-minute incremental `node-cron` job with manual-sync trigger.
- **Interactive event modal** — view details, source account, and category inline.
- **Account management** — connect, disconnect, and rename linked accounts from the UI.

## Security Architecture

This is the part that makes the project a **security portfolio piece**, not just a calendar app:

| Control | Implementation |
|---|---|
| OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow | PKCE-ready; tokens never touch the SPA |
| Session management | Stateless JWT; short access-token lifetime |
| Credential storage | Provider refresh tokens stored in Supabase Postgres with encryption at rest |
| Database authorization | Row-Level Security (RLS) on every table — a user can only read rows they own |
| HTTP hardening | [Helmet.js](https://helmetjs.github.io/) for standard security headers |
| Rate limiting | `express-rate-limit` — 100 requests / 15 min per IP |
| CORS | Origin allowlist, credentials-aware |
| Secret handling | 12-factor `.env` isolation; no secrets in source |

**Planned hardening**: AES-256 at the application layer for refresh tokens, 2FA on the app's own user accounts, PKCE on all OAuth flows, optional SSO (OIDC) for the app itself.

## The Build Journey — Step by Step

This project was built over multiple sessions, from zero to production. Here's the honest, unfiltered timeline including every mistake and how it was resolved.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Session 1)

**Goal:** Scaffold the full-stack project and connect to a database.

**Step 1 — Install Node.js**
Started by trying to run `npm create vite@latest` and got `npm: command not found`. Node.js wasn't installed.

> **Mistake #1:** Assumed Node.js was pre-installed on macOS. It isn't.
> **Fix:** Installed via Homebrew: `brew install node`

**Step 2 — Create the React frontend**
```bash
mkdir mb-ss-dashboard
cd mb-ss-dashboard
npm create vite@latest client -- --template react
cd client && npm install && npm run dev
```
Vite started successfully on `localhost:5173`.

**Step 3 — Create the Express backend**
```bash
mkdir server && cd server
npm init -y
npm install express cors helmet dotenv googleapis @azure/msal-node @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client @supabase/supabase-js jsonwebtoken node-cron express-rate-limit
```
Got "30 packages looking for funding" — this is normal npm behavior, not an error.

**Step 4 — Download and extract starter code**
Generated server boilerplate (routes, middleware, config, services) and downloaded as a zip.

> **Mistake #2:** Tried to `unzip` the file but macOS had auto-extracted it. The zip didn't exist as a `.zip` file anymore.
> **Fix:** Used `find ~/Downloads -name "app.js"` to locate where macOS extracted the files, then `cp -r` to the project directory.

> **Mistake #3:** Hidden files (`.env.example`) didn't copy with the wildcard `cp -r *` command because dotfiles are excluded by default in bash globbing.
> **Fix:** Explicitly copied: `cp ~/Downloads/mb-ss-dashboard/server/.env.example ~/mb-ss-dashboard/server/`

> **Mistake #4:** The `package.json` from `npm init` didn't have the right scripts or dependencies. A separate `package-override.json` was generated but not renamed.
> **Fix:** `cp package-override.json package.json` then `npm install`

**Step 5 — Set up Supabase**
- Created a Supabase project at supabase.com
- Ran the SQL schema in the SQL Editor (creates all 4 tables, indexes, RLS policies, and default data)
- Copied Project URL, anon key, and service role key into `.env`

> **Mistake #5:** Opened `.env~` (backup file) instead of `.env` in nano. The tilde at the end is a nano artifact.
> **Fix:** Made sure to run `nano ~/mb-ss-dashboard/server/.env` with no tilde.

**Step 6 — Verify the stack**
- Backend running on `localhost:3001` with ASCII banner
- `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- `GET /auth/me` returns `{"error":"Access token required"}` — auth middleware working
- Frontend running on `localhost:5173` with default Vite page

> **Phase 1 complete.** Full-stack connected: React frontend, Express backend, Supabase PostgreSQL database.

---

### Phase 2: Google Calendar Integration (Session 2)

**Goal:** OAuth2 flow with Google, sync real calendar events into the database.

**Step 1 — Google Cloud Console setup**
- Created project "mb-ss-dashboard" in Google Cloud Console
- Enabled Google Calendar API, Gmail API, and Google People API
- Configured OAuth consent screen (External user type)
- Created OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application) with redirect URI `http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback`
- Saved Client ID and Client Secret to `.env`

**Step 2 — Test the OAuth flow**
Generated a JWT by calling the login endpoint:
```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@outlook.com","displayName":"MB"}' | grep -o '"token":"[^"]*"' | cut -d'"' -f4)
```

Then requested the Google auth URL:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/auth/google -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

> **Mistake #6:** First attempt to use the token got "expired error" because the token string was mangled during copy-paste (line break inserted).
> **Fix:** Used shell variable assignment (`TOKEN=$(...)`) to capture and reuse the token cleanly without copy-paste issues.

> **Mistake #7:** Google OAuth returned "Access blocked: MB SS Dashboard has not completed the Google verification process. Error 403: access_denied."
> **Fix:** Had to add the Gmail address as a **test user** in Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → Audience → Test users. Apps in "Testing" mode only allow explicitly listed test users.

**Step 3 — Paused and resumed two weeks later**

> **Mistake #8:** Came back after ~12 days and the backend threw `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND lzsgmkmelcujwcngfvym.supabase.co`. Supabase free tier pauses projects after 7 days of inactivity.
> **Fix:** Logged into Supabase dashboard, clicked "Restore" to unpause the project. Took about 30 seconds. Note: once deployed with a cron job pinging every 15 minutes, this never happens again.

> **Mistake #9:** Claude Code (AI terminal assistant) tried to "fix" the DNS error by editing `auth.js` to normalize email casing. This was a red herring — the real problem was the paused database.
> **Lesson:** When using AI coding tools, understand the root cause before accepting suggested code changes. Not every error needs a code fix — sometimes it's infrastructure.

**Step 4 — Successful OAuth connection**
After restoring Supabase and adding the test user, the full OAuth flow worked:
1. Login → get JWT
2. Hit `/auth/google` → get Google consent URL
3. Open URL → authorize in Google
4. Redirect back to app → tokens saved in `connected_accounts` table
5. Verified in Supabase Table Editor: row with `provider: google`, email, access_token, refresh_token all populated.

**Step 5 — Sync calendar events**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/sync/all \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
Server output: `[Google] malcolmtbell@gmail.com: +49 upserted, -0 deleted`

49 real Google Calendar events synced to Supabase with auto-categorization (flights tagged as vacation, gym sessions tagged as gym, etc.).

> **Phase 2 complete.** Google OAuth working, real calendar data syncing and auto-categorized.

---

### Phase 4: Frontend Dashboard (Session 2, continued)

**Goal:** Build the interactive calendar UI with real data.

**Step 1 — Used Claude Code to scaffold the entire frontend**
Gave Claude Code a detailed prompt specifying:
- FullCalendar with month/week/day views
- Color-coding by person (MB=blue, SS=pink, both=purple)
- Login page, dashboard page, settings page
- Tailwind CSS with colorful aesthetic

Claude Code generated all React components, installed dependencies (react-router-dom, FullCalendar, axios, Tailwind), and configured Vite with API proxy.

**Step 2 — Dashboard loaded with real events**
Opened `localhost:5174` (Vite used port 5174 because 5173 was still occupied by the old instance). Logged in as MB, and all 49 Google Calendar events appeared on the calendar in blue.

> **Mistake #10:** Clicking on calendar days or events did nothing — no modals for adding or editing events.
> **Fix:** Had Claude Code add dateClick and eventClick handlers to FullCalendar, plus Add Event and Event Detail modals with full CRUD operations.

**Step 3 — Connected second user (SS)**
- Added SS's Gmail as a test user in Google Cloud Console
- Created SS user via login endpoint
- Ran the OAuth flow for SS's Google account
- Synced SS's events — appeared in pink on the dashboard

> **Mistake #11:** Birthday event (May 5) showed on May 4 in the calendar grid, but the modal correctly showed May 5.
> **Fix:** Timezone issue — FullCalendar was rendering in UTC instead of local time. Set `timeZone: 'local'` in FullCalendar configuration.

> **Phase 4 complete.** Fully interactive dashboard with real data from two Google accounts, color-coded, with CRUD modals.

## Lessons Learned

1. **macOS doesn't ship with Node.js** — always verify dev environment prerequisites before starting
2. **Hidden dotfiles don't copy with wildcards** — `cp -r *` skips `.env` files; copy them explicitly
3. **Google OAuth "Testing" mode requires explicit test users** — won't allow even the developer's own account without adding it to the test user list
4. **Free-tier databases pause on inactivity** — Supabase pauses after 7 days with no API calls; a background cron job solves this permanently
5. **AI coding assistants can misdiagnose infrastructure problems as code bugs** — always understand the root cause before accepting suggested changes
6. **Timezone handling is critical** — store everything in UTC, but configure frontend libraries to display in local time
7. **Copy-paste breaks tokens** — use shell variables to capture and reuse long strings like JWTs instead of manual copy-paste
8. **Phase your builds** — breaking a project into foundation → auth → integration → UI → deploy keeps complexity manageable and lets you verify each layer independently

## Why this is a security portfolio project

Even though the surface use case is a calendar dashboard, the interesting work is all defense-adjacent:

- **Threat modeling** — STRIDE walkthrough of the OAuth surface, the JWT lifecycle, and the multi-tenant data layer.
- **Data-layer authorization** — RLS moves the authorization boundary out of application code and into the database, eliminating "missing where-clause" bug classes.
- **Defense in depth** — Helmet + rate limiting + CORS allowlist + RLS + JWT expiration all stack.
- **Real-world OAuth** — handling refresh tokens, scope narrowing, and consent-screen scope reduction.
